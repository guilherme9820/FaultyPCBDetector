# Faulty PCB Detector

The purpose of this project is to identify defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) based on image processing. This problem was tackled in two ways: The first one using classical algorithms such as Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) and Histogram of Gradients (HoG) and the second one using Artificial Neural Networks, MaskRCNN architecture specifically.
